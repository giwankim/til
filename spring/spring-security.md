# Spring Security

Provides authentication, authorization, and protection against common attacks. Supports both
imperative and reactive applications.

## Features

### Authentication

Authentication is how we verify the identity of who is trying to access a particular resource.

### Authorization

Authorization is determining who is allowed to access a particular resource. Spring Security
provides defense in depth by allowing for request based authorization and method based
authorization.

### Protection Against Exploits

#### Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
