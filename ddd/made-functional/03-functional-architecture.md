# 3. Functional Architecture

Software architecture terminology from Simon Brown's "C4" approach:

- The "system context" is the top level, representing the entire system.
- The system context comprises a number of "containers," which are deployable units.
- "component"
- "classes"

One of the goals of good architecture is to define the various boundaries between containers,
components, and modules, such that when new requirements arise, the "cost of change" is minimized.

## Bounded Contexts as Autonomous Software Components

## Communicating between Bounded Contexts

## Contracts between Bounded Contexts

## Workflows within a Bounded Context

## Code Structure within a Bounded Context
