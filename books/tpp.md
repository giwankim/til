# The Pragmatic Programmer

The word _pragmatic_ comes from the Latin _pragmaticus_--"skilled in business"--which in turn is derevied from the Greek $\pi\rho\alpha\gamma\mu\alpha\tau\iota\kappa\'{\omicron}\sigma$, meaning "fit for use."

There are no easy answer. There can only systems that are more appropriate in a particular set of circumstances.

This is where pragmatism comes in.

You adjust your approach to suit the current circumstances and environment.

The book is aimed at people who want to become more effective and more productive programmers.

A Pragmatic programmer has the following characteristics:

- Early adopter/fast adapter
- Inquisitive
- Critical thinker
- Realistic
- Jack of all trades

__Tip 1: Care about your craft__

__Tip 2: Think! About your work__

__Individual Pragmatists, Large Teams__

There _should_ be engineering in software construction. Within the overall structure of a project there is always room for individuality and craftsmanship.

__It's a Continuous Process__

"Kaizen" is a Japanese term that captures te concept of continuously making many small improvements. Every day, work to refine the skills you have and to add new tools to your repertoire.

## 1. A Pragmatic Philosophy

It's _your_ career, and more importantly, [It's Your Life](#its-your-life).

What distinguishes Pragmatic Programmers? We feel it's an attitude, a style, a philosophy of approaching problems and their solutions. They think beyond the immediate problem, placing it in its larger context and seeking out the bigger picture.

Another key to their success is that Pragmatic Programmers take responsibility for everything they do, which we discuss in [The Cat At My Source Code](#the-cat-ate-my-source-code). Being responsible, Pragmatic Programmers won't sit idly by and watch their projects fall apart through neglect. In [Software Entropy](#software-entropy), we tell you how to keep your projects pristine.

Many people find change difficult, sometimes for good reasons, sometimes because of plain old inertia. In [Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs](#stone-soup-and-boiled-frogs), we look at a strategy for instigating change and (in the interests of balance) present the cautionary tale of an amphibian that ignored the dangers of gradual change.

One of the benefits of understanding the context is that it becomes easier to know just how good your software has to be. Often there are trade-offs involved. We explore this in [Good-Enough Software](#good-enough-software)

You need to have a broad base of knowledge and experience to pull all of this off. Leaning is a continuous and ongoing process. In [Your Knowledge Portfolio](#your-knowledge-portfolio), we discuss some strategies for keeping the momentum up.

We all spend a large amount of time interacting with others. [Communicate!](#communicate) lists ways we can do this better.
