# 5. Design a Consistent Hashing

To achieve horizontal scaling, it is important to distribute request/data efficiently and evenly across servers.

Consistent hashing is a commonly used technique to achieve this goal.

## Rehashing problem

Given $n$ cache servers, a common way to balance the load is to use

$$server = hash(key) \% N$$

where N is the size of the server pool.

The approach works well when the size of the server pool is fixed, and the data is evenly distributed.

However, problem arises when new servers are added, or existing servers are removed.

For example, consider the case of 4 servers (0, 1, 2, 3) and 9 keys with their hashes:

| key | hash | hash % 4 |
| --- | ---- | -------- |
| key0 | 18358617 | 1 |
| key1 | 26143584 | 0 |
| key2 | 18131146 | 2 |
| key3 | 35863496 | 0 |
| key4 | 34085809 | 1 |
| key5 | 27581703 | 3 |
| key6 | 38164978 | 2 |
| key7 | 22530351 | 3 |

Then, the keys are distributed among the 4 servers as follows:

![servers](../../assets/hashing.png)

If server 1 goes offline keys are redistributed as follows as a result of modular operation with number of server reduced by 1:

![rehashed](../../assets/rehashed.png)

| key | hash | hash % 3 |
| --- | ---- | -------- |
| key0 | 18358617 | 0 |
| key1 | 26143584 | 0 |
| key2 | 18131146 | 1 |
| key3 | 35863496 | 2 |
| key4 | 34085809 | 1 |
| key5 | 27581703 | 0 |
| key6 | 38164978 | 1 |
| key7 | 22530351 | 0 |

Most keys are redistributed, not just the ones originally stored in server 1. This means that when server 1 goes offline, most clients will connect to different servers resulting in a storm of cache misses.

## Consistent hashing

> Consistent hashing is a special kind of hashing such that when a hash table is re-sized and consistent hashing is used, only k/n keys need to be remapped onn average, where k is the number of keys, and n is the number of slots. [^1]

The basic steps of consistent hashing algorithm introduced by Karger et al. [^2] are:

  - Map servers and keys on to hash ring using a uniformly distributed hash function.
  - To find out which server a key is mapped, go clockwise from the key position until the first server on the ring is found.

### Hash space and hash ring

A hash function maps elements to "buckets," such as 160-bits in the case of SHA-1.

In this case, _hash space_ is integers from $0$ to $2^{160} - 1$.

By identifying the two ends, $0$ to $2^{160} - 1$, we get a _hash ring._

### Hash servers

The key idea is that in addition to hashing the keys as before, _we also hash the names (or IPs) of the cache servers._

### Hash keys

### Server lookup

### Add a server

### Remove a server

### Two issues in the basic approach

### Virtual nodes

### Find affected keys

## Wrap up

Consistent hashing is widely used in real-world systems, including

- Partitioning component of Amazon's Dynamo database
- Data partitioning across the cluster in Apache Cassandra
- Discord chat application
- Akamai CDN
- Maglev network load balancer
